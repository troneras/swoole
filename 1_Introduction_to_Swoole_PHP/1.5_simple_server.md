# Demo 1: Creating a Simple Server:

In this section, we will create a simple server that will listen on port 8080 and respond with a simple message.

### Create a new file named `server.php` with this contents

```php
<?php

use OpenSwoole\Http\Server;
use OpenSwoole\Http\Request;
use OpenSwoole\Http\Response;

$server = new Server("0.0.0.0", 9501);

$server->on("start", function (Server $server) {
    echo "Swoole http server is started at http://127.0.0.1:9501\n";
});

$server->on("request", function (Request $request, Response $response) {
    $response->header("Content-Type", "text/plain");
    $response->end("Hello World\n");
});

$server->start();
```
We use OpenSwoole's `Http\Server` class to create a new server instance. The `Http\Server` class is a subclass of `Swoole\Server` class, which is the core class of Swoole. The `Http\Server` class provides a simple way to create a HTTP server.

Apart from HTTP servers, Openswoole also provides HTTP2, WebSocket, TCP, UDP, and a special case of TCP called Redis server. We will cover these in later sections.

### Note on class name warnings
> Note: If you use the code as above you will notice warnings on class names. This is because this classes are part of the OpenSwoole extension and not part of the PHP core. To fix this you can either install openswoole/ide-helper with `composer require --dev openswoole/ide-helper:~22.0.1`. More info: https://github.com/openswoole/ide-helper
> 
> Then add `require 'vendor/autoload.php';` to the top of the file.

### Note on function ***go*** not defined
Add the following file:
```php
<?php
// PHPStormStubs.php

namespace {
    /**
     * This function is provided by the OpenSwoole extension. Is an alias for OpenSwoole\Coroutine::create().
     *
     * @param callable $callback [required]
     * @param mixed ...$params
     * @return int|false
     */
    function go(callable $callback, ...$params)
    {
    }
}

```
